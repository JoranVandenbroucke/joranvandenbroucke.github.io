### About

Nox was my first group project, here I learned the value of communication, and how smooth work goes when youâ€™re all on
the same wavelength.
My team had four artists and two programmers, I was one of the programmers.
We used Unreal Engine 4, and as part of the assignment, the programmers could only use Unreal C++ if they chose to go
with Unreal.

In this project, I handled the spiders (enemy), the save mechanic, camera and character movement.
The game is available on <a href="https://silkevdsmissen.itch.io/nox">itch.io</a>.

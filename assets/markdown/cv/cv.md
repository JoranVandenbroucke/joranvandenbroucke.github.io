# Profile

![Profile Picture](assets/img/ProfilePicture.png#avatar)

I am a student of Master Game Technologies. For this master, I research how the Local Clearance Minimum can be extracted from a navmesh so that navmeshes can be unified.

I am currently looking for a job that I can start beginning February or April 2024. I focus on low-level programming, especially graphics programming (Vulkan and OpenGL) and all around Game AI implementations (nav mesh, octree...).

## Hobbies and Interests

I like programming. Just the feeling that you get when you hit the build button, and it has no errors. Even better, you run your program, and it works as intended.

Besides programming, I like doing 3D modeling; it is visually pleasing. I also love to play some games now and then, especially if it is VR, AR, or XR. I also like it when it has a unique input system like a Tobii Eye Tracker, Leap Motion, or the Xbox Kinect.

Outside the gaming world, I also like to do some sports. I have been bouldering for a year now. Besides bouldering, you can also find me taking a swim, or you see me on a Sunday morning running along the road while listening to "Zombies, Run!". The majority of the time, I have music playing. The genres I listen to can be of all sorts, ranging from classical music to heavy metal; all genres are welcome.

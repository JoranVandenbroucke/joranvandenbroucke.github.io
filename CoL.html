                                Child of Lothian is a group project of about 22 students, eight artists, ten designers
                                and four programmers.
                                I am the AI programmer in the group.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                In Child of Lothian, you play as an Orphan who has been robbed of her childhood as her
                                family is put to
                                trial during the 18th century Witch Hunt trials. The game takes place in the old town of
                                Edinburgh.
                                <br/>

                                As the AI programmer in this project, my goal was to make the NPCs good enough to make
                                the city feel lively;
                                and the guards react smartly to troublemakers. I will mainly focus on underlying
                                techniques like LODs for
                                AI, Tactical nodes and spacial partition mapping.

                                My part in this project was the creation of general NPC behaviour. The first NPC we
                                created, I called Brain.
                                Brain is the base NPC for all interactive NPCs to come and for all witch hunters to
                                follow. Brian was part
                                of the first playable. He will only step aside if the player completes his quest or if
                                he gets distracted
                                because the player destroyed a lamp.<br/>Right now, he has replaced bey the final
                                versions.

                                To realize this, I enhanced the navmesh with a technique discussed in a GDC talk: <a
                                    href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1018038/Spaces-in-the-Sandbox-Tactical">Spaces
                                in the Sandbox
                                Tactical</a>.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                Each node on the navmesh knows its neighbours and the nodes it's easy to get to; it also
                                knows which nodes
                                are visible and how interesting a node is. The interest value tells Brain if there is
                                something he needs to
                                check out.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                Combining that with an EQS (environment query system), I can steer/direct Brain where I
                                want him to go. Our
                                Brain has four modes the first one is "idle", the second one is "suspicious", the third
                                one is "confirmed",
                                and the fourth one is "find clue".
